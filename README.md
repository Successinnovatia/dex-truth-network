# Dextruth: Decentralized News for Truth  
*Enugu, Nigeria* – In an era of media bias, misinformation, and eroding trust, **Dextruth** proposes a blockchain-powered, user-verified news ecosystem to restore credibility, resist censorship, and protect privacy.  

## 🔍 The Crisis in Modern Media  
The current landscape suffers from:  
- **Centralized control**: Biased narratives dominate mainstream outlets.  
- **Misinformation epidemics**: Fake news spreads unchecked, undermining democracy.  
- **Censorship threats**: Independent reporting is silenced in restrictive regimes.  
- **Privacy risks**: User data is exploited by centralized platforms.  

## 🛠️ The Dextruth Solution  
### 🌐 **Blockchain-Powered Transparency**  
- Immutable record of news stories to prevent manipulation.  
- Timestamped, tamper-proof archives for accountability.  

### 👥 **User-Verified Ecosystem**  
- Decentralized consensus mechanisms to validate facts.  
- Reputation systems for journalists and contributors.  

### 🛡️ **Censorship Resistance**  
- Distributed storage ensures no single entity can suppress news.  
- Permissionless publishing for diverse global voices.  

### 🔒 **Privacy by Design**  
- Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) or pseudonymous identities to protect sources/users.  
- On-chain encryption for sensitive data.  

## Why This Matters
